# Onboarding the next 10 billion on Earth, Moon and Mars on Ethereum

## Vision

We could envision a world where Ethereum clients runs on small, resource-constrained compute modules, like single-board computers and microcontrollers, which have internet connectivity. This integration would harness the power of Ethereum's decentralized framework in the rapidly expanding domain of robotics and IoT, projected to reach about 30 billion connections by the 2030s. The project could eventually extend beyond Earth, foreseeing a future where robots and IoT devices, powered by Ethereum, operate on the Moon and eventually Mars. The decentralized systems could function in extreme, resource-limited environments, potentially transforming interplanetary communication and data exchange.
